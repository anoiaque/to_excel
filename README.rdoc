= Introduction 
I first used the good "arydjmal/to_xls" plugin but it doesn't allow collections of multiples objects from different class and can't export
associations attributes of a class.

With to_excel gem you can export multiples collections of objects of different class, moreover you have the possibility of
exporting associations's attributes (recursively).
